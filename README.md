# IC-EEG

This repo constains the files I use and develop in my undergrad research project on brain semantic decoding using deeplearning on EEG signals. For more details, visit my Github page.

Summarizing the contents of the folders:

- Binary: contains experiments of the EEGNet on the THINGS-EEG, preprocessed by Gifford, on binary classification.
- K-Class: contains experiments of the EEGNet on the THINGS-EEG, preprocessed by Gifford, on multiclass and multisubject classification.
- Riemann: contains files with riemann-based classification.

Experiments and advances are most surely documented and commented on my Github page.

The datafiles generators and some imports consider my environment, so the codes will not run directly. If you want to reproduce the results, you will need to change the paths on them.

The libraries most used are:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- PyRiemann
- Braindecode
- Sklearn

it is possible that I forgot some.
